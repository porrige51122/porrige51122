# 👋 Welcome to My GitHub Page! 🚀

I'm a Senior Cloud Security Engineer at Centrica, passionate about cloud computing. I thrive on creating diverse projects using various languages like Golang, Python, Java, and more! While some projects are private for legal reasons, you can still explore a few here. 😉

Always eager to expand my skill set, I'm currently exploring virtualization systems like Proxmox to supercharge my projects. 🖥️

Stay tuned for more updates and cool projects coming your way! 🎉
